# Zangband

I've always loved Zangband and it's been abandoned and dead far too long. My goals for this (VERY) part time project:

- LUA is gone. Replace with something not shit.
- The Borg is gone. AI has moved on. Maybe add an API to allow real AI to drive Zangband.
- Something more modern in the tiles implementation. Crossplatform, not sure what.

Once all those are done, I'll start looking at the game itself. When I worked on it in the past I had some improvements, but that was long ago and far away.


Changes:

Meson is now working to build the Windows version of Zangband. I'm not sure if it's working for the other platforms yet. No sound or tiles, that's next.
